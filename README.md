This is the code for my [website](https://larakelley.com). It's
intentionally a little overkill for a personal website, as it functions as
a playground for experimentation with web frameworks and APIs.

Feel free to copy whatever you like from the repository for personal use!

- [Go](https://go.dev) - Go programming language
